We were not okay with that. <br\/><br\/>This dearth gave rise to a promise - to curate daily wear that was equal parts stylish, comfortable, and affordable. A small team came together with a vision to fulfill this promise. Endless sampling of fabrics, numerous design ideations, and sketches later a brand was born – MULMUL.<\/p>",
